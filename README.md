## Overview

Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.

**This Fork:** This repository is a fork of the original [Perplexica project](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica) with additional features, improvements, and an independent installation system using local build for complete independence from external registries. We maintain this fork separately to provide enhanced functionality while staying true to the original project's goals.

Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it [here](https://github.com/Kamran1819G/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md).

## Features

- **Local LLMs**: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.
- **Two Main Modes:**
  - **Copilot Mode:** (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user's query directly from the page.
  - **Normal Mode:** Processes your query and performs a web search.
- **Focus Modes:** Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
  - **All Mode:** Searches the entire web to find the best results.
  - **Writing Assistant Mode:** Helpful for writing tasks that do not require searching the web.
  - **Academic Search Mode:** Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.
  - **YouTube Search Mode:** Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.
  - **Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:** Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.
  - **Reddit Search Mode:** Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.
- **Current Information:** Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.
- **API**: Integrate Perplexica into your existing applications and make use of its capibilities.

It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in [upcoming features](#upcoming-features).

## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

The quick start guide above covers the basic Docker setup. For detailed Docker instructions including development with live updates, production deployment, and troubleshooting, see the **[Docker Setup Guide](docs/DOCKER.md)**.

#### For Contributors
- Use `docker-compose up --build` for development with live updates
- Your changes will be reflected live in the running container
- If you add dependencies, rebuild with `docker-compose up --build`
- The GitHub Actions workflow for Docker images is now only for official releases and is not required for local development

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings.
2. Clone the repository and rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml` in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.
3. After populating the configuration run `npm i`.
4. Install the dependencies and then execute `npm run build`.
5. Finally, start the app by running `npm run start`

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/Kamran1819G/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like updating, etc.

### Ollama Connection Errors

If you're encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama's API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:11434`

   Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.

3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"`. Then restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser's settings.
2. Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.

## Using Perplexica's API

Perplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.

For more details, check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/Kamran1819G/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md).

## Expose Perplexica to network

Perplexica runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.

## One-Click Deployment

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** One-click deployment services may not work with the current local build setup. These services typically expect pre-built Docker images from registries, but this project uses local builds for complete independence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

For developers who want to contribute to Perplexica or run it in development mode with hot reloading:

### Quick Development Start

#### Linux/macOS:
```bash
# Start development environment (SearXNG in Docker + Next.js on host)
./dev.sh

# Stop development environment
./stop-dev.sh
```

#### Windows:
```cmd
# Start development environment (SearXNG in Docker + Next.js on host)
dev.bat

# Stop development environment
stop-dev.bat
```

### Manual Development Setup

1. **Start SearXNG in Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d searxng
   ```

2. **Start Next.js on Host Machine:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   yarn dev
   ```

### Development Architecture

- **SearXNG**: Runs in Docker container (http://localhost:4000)
- **Next.js App**: Runs directly on host machine (http://localhost:3000)
- **Hot Reloading**: Full hot reloading for Next.js development
- **Search Integration**: App connects to SearXNG via localhost:4000

### Why This Approach?

**Docker hot reloading was not possible** due to volume mounting conflicts with Next.js App Router. The Next.js application couldn't find the `app` directory when mounted as volumes in Docker containers.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach where:
- SearXNG runs in Docker (for search functionality)
- Next.js runs directly on host machine (for fast development with hot reloading)
